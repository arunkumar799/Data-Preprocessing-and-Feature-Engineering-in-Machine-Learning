# Data-Preprocessing-and-Feature-Engineering-in-Machine-Learning
This assignment focuses on enhancing machine learning model efficiency through data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques on the "Adult" dataset. Students will explore data, handle missing values, apply scaling and encoding methods, create new features, and perform feature selection to improve predictive accuracy.
